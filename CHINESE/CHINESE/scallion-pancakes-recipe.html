        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups All-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3/4 cup Boiling water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Chopped green onions (scallions)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Sesame oil</li>
            <li>Additional salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, add flour and salt. Gradually pour in the boiling water while stirring with chopsticks or a spoon to form the dough.</li>
            <li>Once the dough is cool enough to handle, knead it on a floured surface for about 5 minutes until smooth. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the dough has rested, divide it into four equal portions. Roll each portion into a thin circle (about 6-8 inches in diameter).</li>
            <li>Brush each dough circle with a small amount of sesame oil, then sprinkle evenly with chopped scallions and a pinch of salt.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough up like a log, then coil it into a round shape. Flatten each coil into a disc again.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Once hot, place one pancake in the pan and fry for 2-3 minutes on each side until golden and crispy. Repeat with the remaining pancakes.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, remove from the pan and let them drain on paper towels. Cut into wedges and serve warm.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your crispy, savory scallion pancakes!</li>
