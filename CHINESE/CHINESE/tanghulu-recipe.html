        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>10-12 Skewered fruits (usually hawthorn, but you can use strawberries, grapes, or other fruits)</li>
            <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Cornstarch (optional for thickening)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon Lemon juice (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and prepare the fruits. If using hawthorn, remove the seeds and place the fruits on skewers.</li>
            <li>In a small pot, combine sugar and water. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.</li>
            <li>Bring the syrup to a boil and cook for 5-7 minutes until it reaches the hard crack stage (around 300°F / 150°C). Optionally, you can add lemon juice to prevent crystallization.</li>
            <li>If you want thicker syrup, you can mix cornstarch with a bit of water, add it to the syrup, and cook for another minute.</li>
            <li>Carefully dip the skewered fruits into the hot syrup, making sure they are completely coated. Place the coated fruits on a parchment paper-lined tray to cool.</li>
            <li>Allow the candies to cool for 10-15 minutes until the syrup hardens, and the candy coating becomes crunchy.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy your homemade Tanghulu!</li>
